1. Interactive Match Results Viewer: A web application built with Python and Flask that allows users to select any two participating teams from the 2022 World Cup and view their head-to-head match results. This includes scores, date, time, team flags, and other key match statistics, presented in a user-friendly interface.
   
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): A detailed analysis performed in a Jupyter Notebook using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. This EDA aims to uncover trends, analyze team performances, and derive statistical insights from the group stages through to the final match of the tournament.

these components demonstrate skills in web application development with a data focus, data processing and manipulation (ETL), interactive data presentation, and thorough exploratory data analysis to derive meaningful conclusions from sports data.


 Tools: Python, Flask, Pandas, HTML and CSS, JavaScript, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
